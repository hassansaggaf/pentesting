# How to Create a Virus

## Batch files

Batch files are equivalent to cmd commands but stored in a file as a script

**Basic commands**

```
%echo off
echo Hello World
pause

%echo off          : disable all repetition of a command
echo Hello World   : prints Hello World
pause              : waits for user input before closing
```

**Variables**

```
%echo off
set /p a=Enter your name:
echo Hello %a%
pause

set /p     : Take input from the user 
%a%        : the variable
```

**Useful Examples**

**Pinger**
```
%echo off
set /p target=Enter an IP
ping %target% -t
pause
```
